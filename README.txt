PhrasesPd

PhrasesPd is a MIDI sequencer, controllable by any grid controller capable of using the Monome OSC communications format.

It has an integrated sequence editor, which is controlled by a combination of computer keyboard, MIDI controller, and grid controller.

Installation

1. Put all of PhrasesPd's .pd_lua files into your /pd/extra directory.
2. Make sure all of PhrasesPd's .pd files are in the same folder as one another. The directory itself can be wherever, but preferably somewhere convenient in your directory structure, as your savefiles will be loaded from within the same folder (or a sub-folder, if you specify so).
3. Run "phrasespd.pd" in PureData.
